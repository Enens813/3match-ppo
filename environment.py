"""
Initialization:

Possibly connect to BlueStacks via ADB or a direct input-injection library.
Define observation space (the shape of the game board or some flattened representation).
Define action space (which piece swap do you do?).
Reset:

Restart the match-3 level or game.
Capture a fresh screen to get the initial state.
Return the initial observation.
Step:

Interpret the integer action as a swap in the match-3 grid (e.g., swap piece (row, col) with a neighbor).
Send the input to BlueStacks.
Wait a moment to let the move resolve (the pieces might cascade).
Capture the new screen and interpret it as the new state.
Compute the reward (e.g., difference in score, number of matches, or some in-game points).
Determine if the game is over (done).
